In this work, we propose a self-supervised method to make language models more robust against negation. We introduce a novel task, Next Sentence Polarity Prediction (NSPP), and a variation of the Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) task. We show that RoBERTa and BERT further pre-trained on our tasks outperform the off-the-shelf transformer models on eight negation-related benchmarks. Most notably, the pretrainings yield between 1.8% and 9.1% improvement on CondaQA, a large question-answering corpus requiring reasoning over negation.},

Then, using an off-the-shelf NLI model we track how the entailment progresses with these atomic changes, aggregating these intermediate labels into a final output. We demonstrate the advantages of our proposed method particularly in realistic cross-domain settings, where our method always outperforms strong baselines with improvements up to 12.6% (relative). Further, our proposed approach is explainable as the atomic edits can be used to understand the overall NLI label.",

Our approach divides IE tasks into two steps: (1) text classification to understand what information (e.g., entity or event types) is contained in the underlying text and (2) information extraction for the identified types. Initially, we use a large language model (LLM) in a few-shot setting to classify the contained information. The classification output is used to select the relevant prompt and retrieve the examples relevant to the input text. Finally, we ask a LLM to do the information extraction with the generated prompt. By evaluating our approach on legal IE tasks with two different LLMs, we demonstrate that the prompt chaining technique improves the LLMâ€™s overall performance in a few-shot setting when compared to the baseline in which examples from all possible classes are included in the prompt. Our approach can be used in a low-resource setting as it does not require a large amount of training data. Also, it can be easily adapted to many different IE tasks by simply adjusting the prompts. Lastly, it provides a cost benefit by reducing the number of tokens in the prompt.",

This approach capitalizes on the strengths of both paradigms: the adaptability of rule-based systems and the generalization power of neural networks. Our architecture consists of two components: a declarative rule-based model for transparent classification and a neural component to enhance rule generalizability through semantic text matching. Notably, our semantic matcher is trained in an unsupervised domain-agnostic way, solely with synthetic data. Further, these components are loosely coupled, allowing for rule modifications without retraining the semantic matcher. In our evaluation, we focused on two few-shot relation classification datasets: Few-Shot TACRED and a Few-Shot version of NYT29. We show that our proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art models in three out of four settings, despite not seeing any human-annotated training data. Further, we show that our approach remains modular and pliable, i.e., the corresponding rules can be locally modified to improve the overall model. Human interventions to the rules for the TACRED relation \texttt{org:parents} boost the performance on that relation by as much as 26\% relative improvement, without negatively impacting the other relations, and without retraining the semantic matching component.",

We explore whether annotating at sub-sentence level can translate to an improved downstream performance by considering two different sub-sentence annotation strategies: (i) entity-level, and (ii) token-level. These approaches result in some sentences being only partially annotated. To address this issue, we introduce and evaluate multiple strategies to deal with partially-annotated sentences during the training process. We show that annotating at the sub-sentence level achieves comparable or better performance than sentence-level annotations with a smaller number of annotated tokens. We then explore the extent to which the performance gap remains once accounting for the annotation time and found that both annotation schemes perform similarly.",

ELLEN achieves very strong performance on the CoNLL-2003 dataset when using the minimal supervision from the lexicon above. It also outperforms most existing (and considerably more complex) semi-supervised NER methods under the same supervision settings commonly used in the literature (i.e., 5% of the training data). Further, we evaluate our CoNLL-2003 model in a zero-shot scenario on WNUT-17 where we find that it outperforms GPT-3.5 and achieves comparable performance to GPT-4. In a zero-shot setting, ELLEN also achieves over 75% of the performance of a strong, fully supervised model trained on gold data. Our code is available at: https://github.com/hriaz17/ELLEN",

As a result, it is currently employed in a variety of real-world contexts, from legal reasoning to intelligence analysis. An argumentation framework is modelled as a graph where the nodes represent arguments and the edges of the graph represent relations (i.e., supports, attacks) between nodes. In this work, we investigate the ability of neural network methods to learn a gradual bipolar argumentation semantics, which allows for both supports and attacks. We begin by calculating the acceptability degrees for graph nodes. These scores are generated using Quantitative Argumentation Debate (QuAD) argumentation semantics. We apply this approach to two benchmark datasets: Twelve Angry Men and Debate- pedia. Using this data, we train and evaluate the performance of three benchmark architectures: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Graph Convolution Network (GCN), and Graph Attention Network (GAT) to learn the acceptability degree scores produced by the QuAD semantics. Our results show that these neural network methods can learn bipolar gradual argumentation semantics. The models trained on GCN architecture perform better than the other two architectures underscoring the importance of modelling argumentation graphs explicitly."

Beyond simply capturing speaker switches, identifying how speakers interact with each other in a dialogue is crucial to understanding conversational flow. This becomes increasingly important and simultaneously difficult to model when more than two interlocutors take part in a conversation. To overcome this challenge, we propose to explicitly add speaker awareness to each utterance representation. To that end, we use a graph neural network to model how each speaker is behaving within the local context of a conversation. The speaker representations learned this way are then used to update their respective utterance representations. We experiment with both multiparticipant and dyadic conversations on the MRDA and SwDA datasets and show the effectiveness of our approach.",

    abstract = "To avoid detection by current NLP monitoring applications, progenitors of hate speech often replace one or more letters in offensive words with homoglyphs, visually similar Unicode characters. Harvesting real-world hate speech containing homoglyphs is challenging due to the vast replacement possibilities. We developed a character substitution scraping method and assembled the Offensive Tweets with Homoglyphs (OTH) Dataset (N=90,788) with more than 1.5 million occurrences of 1,281 non-Latin characters (emojis excluded). In an annotated sample (n=700), 40.14{\%} of the tweets were found to contain hate speech. We assessed the performance of seven transformer-based hate speech detection models and found that they performed poorly in a zero-shot setting (F1 scores between 0.04 and 0.52) but normalizing the data dramatically improved detection (F1 scores between 0.59 and 0.71). Training the models using the annotated data further boosted performance (highest micro-averaged F1 score=0.88, using five-fold cross validation). This study indicates that a dataset containing homoglyphs known and unknown to the scraping script can be collected, and that neural models can be trained to recognize camouflaged real-world hate speech.",

We fine-tuned a pre-trained model on the task of evaluating the validity of legal will statements, once with the dataset containing the Tennessee wills and once with the dataset containing the Idaho wills. Each modelâ€™s performance on the in-domain setting and the out-of-domain setting are compared to see if the models can across the states. We found that the model trained on one US state can be mostly transferred to another state. However, it is clear that the modelâ€™s performance drops in the out-of-domain setting. The F1 scores of the Tennessee model and the Idaho model are 96.41 and 92.03 when predicting the data from the same state, but they drop to 66.32 and 81.60 when predicting the data from another state. Subsequent error analysis revealed that there are two major sources of errors. First, the model fails to recognize equivalent laws across states when there are stylistic differences between laws. Second, difference in statutory section numbering system between the states makes it difficult for the model to locate laws relevant to the cases being predicted on. This analysis provides insights on how the future NLI system can be improved. Also, our findings offer empirical support to legal experts advocating the standardization of legal documents.",

The dataset consists of entities, binary relations between the entities (e.g., relations between testator and beneficiary), and n-ary events (e.g., bequest) extracted from 45 legal wills from two US states. This dataset can serve as a foundation for downstream tasks in the legal domain. Another use case of this dataset is evaluating the performance of large language models (LLMs) on this IE task. We evaluated GPT-4 with our dataset to investigate its ability to extract information from legal wills. Our evaluation result demonstrates that the model is capable of handling the task reasonably well. When given instructions and examples as a prompt, GPT-4 shows decent performance for both entity extraction and relation extraction tasks. Nevertheless, the evaluation result also reveals that the model is not perfect. We observed inconsistent outputs (given a prompt) as well as prompt over-generalization.",

As generating annotated examples are expensive, recent zero-shot methods have been proposed that reformulate RC into other NLP tasks for which supervision exists such as textual entailment. However, these methods rely on templates that are manually created which is costly and requires domain expertise. In this paper, we present a novel strategy for template generation for relation classification, which is based on adapting Harris{'} distributional similarity principle to templates encoded using contextualized representations. Further, we perform empirical evaluation of different strategies for combining the automatically acquired templates with manual templates. The experimental results on TACRED show that our approach not only performs better than the zero-shot RC methods that only use manual templates, but also that it achieves state-of-the-art performance for zero-shot TACRED at 64.3 F1 score.",

Children{'}s exposure to sexually suggestive videos has been shown to have adversarial effects on their development (Collins et al. 2017). Meanwhile, virtual sex education, especially on subjects that are more relevant to the LGBTQIA+ community, is very valuable (Mitchell et al. 2014). The platform{'}s current system removes/punishes some of both types of videos, even though they serve different purposes. Our dataset contains video URLs, and it is also audio transcribed. To validate its importance, we explore two transformer-based models for classifying the videos. Our preliminary results suggest that the task of distinguishing between these types of videos is learnable but challenging. These experiments suggest that this dataset is meaningful and invites further study on the subject.",

We insert light supervision in the form of seed patterns or relations, and model it with several custom teleportation probabilities that bias random-walk scores of patterns/relations based on their proximity to correct information. We evaluate our approach on Few-Shot TACRED, and show that our method outperforms (or performs competitively with) more expensive and opaque deep neural networks. Lastly, we thoroughly compare our proposed approach with the seminal RlogF pattern acquisition algorithm of, showing that it outperforms it for all the hyper parameters tested, in all settings. }",

alignment probabilities from semi-structured data such as question-answer
pairs; neural network language models learn term embeddings from
unstructured text. All this knowledge is then used to estimate the semantic
similarity between question and answer candidates.  We introduce a
higher-order formalism that allows all these lexical semantic models to
chain direct evidence to construct indirect associations between question
and answer texts, by casting the task as the traversal of graphs that encode
direct term associations.  Using a corpus of 10,000 questions from Yahoo!
Answers, we experimentally demonstrate that higher-order methods are broadly
applicable to alignment and language models, across both word and syntactic
representations. We show that an important criterion for success is
controlling for the semantic drift that accumulates during graph traversal.
All in all, the proposed higher-order approach improves five out of the six
lexical semantic models investigated, with relative gains of up to +13\%
over their first-order variants. },

Our approach addresses this task as link prediction over a graph that contains over 2M influence statements such as ``CTCF activates FOXA1'', which were automatically extracted using open-domain machine reading. We model this prediction task using graph-based features extracted from the above influence graph, as well as from a citation graph that captures scientific communities. We evaluated the proposed approach through backtesting. Although the data is heavily unbalanced (50 times more negative examples than positives), our approach predicts which influence links will be discovered in the ``near future'' with a F1 score of 27 points, and a mean average precision of 68\%. },

In this paper, we investigate another potential use of neural TS: assisting machines performing natural language processing (NLP) tasks. We evaluate the use of neural TS in two ways: simplifying input texts at prediction time and augmenting data to provide machines with additional information during training. We demonstrate that the latter scenario provides positive effects on machine performance on two separate datasets. In particular, the latter use of TS improves the performances of LSTM (1.82{--}1.98{\%}) and SpanBERT (0.7{--}1.3{\%}) extractors on TACRED, a complex, large-scale, real-world relation extraction task. Further, the same setting yields improvements of up to 0.65{\%} matched and 0.62{\%} mismatched accuracies for a BERT text classifier on MNLI, a practical natural language inference dataset.",

Our approach uses a multi-task learning architecture, which jointly trains a classifier for relation extraction, and a sequence model that labels words in the context of the relations that explain the decisions of the relation classifier. We also convert the model outputs to rules to bring global explanations to this approach. This sequence model is trained using a hybrid strategy: supervised, when supervision from pre-existing patterns is available, and semi-supervised otherwise. In the latter situation, we treat the sequence modelâ€™s labels as latent variables, and learn the best assignment that maximizes the performance of the relation classifier. We evaluate the proposed approach on the two datasets and show that the sequence model provides labels that serve as accurate explanations for the relation classifierâ€™s decisions, and, importantly, that the joint training generally improves the performance of the relation classifier. We also evaluate the performance of the generated rules and show that the new rules are a great add-on to the manual rules and bring the rule-based system much closer to the neural models.}",

  abstract = {We propose an unsupervised method for the identification of bridge phrases in multi-hop question answering (QA). Our method
constructs a graph of noun phrases from the question and the available context, and applies the Steiner tree algorithm to identify
the minimal sub-graph that connects all question phrases. Nodes in the sub-graph that bridge loosely-connected or disjoint
subsets of question phrases due to low-strength semantic relations are extracted as bridge phrases. The identified bridge phrases
are then used to expand the query based on the initial question, helping in increasing the relevance of evidence that has little
lexical overlap or semantic relation with the question. Through an evaluation on HotpotQA(Yang et al., 2018), a popular dataset
for multi-hop QA, we show that our method yields: (a) improved evidence retrieval, (b) improved QA performance when using
the retrieved sentences; and (c) effective and faithful explanations when answers are provided.},
