    abstract="{In this paper we revisit the direction of using lexico-syntactic patterns for relation extraction instead of today's ubiquitous neural classifiers. We propose a semi-supervised graph-based algorithm for pattern acquisition that scores patterns and the relations they extract jointly, using a variant of PageRank. We insert light supervision in the form of seed patterns or relations, and model it with several custom teleportation probabilities that bias random-walk scores of patterns/relations based on their proximity to correct information. We evaluate our approach on Few-Shot TACRED, and show that our method outperforms (or performs competitively with) more expensive and opaque deep neural networks. Lastly, we thoroughly compare our proposed approach with the seminal RlogF pattern acquisition algorithm of, showing that it outperforms it for all the hyper parameters tested, in all settings. }",

On a second evaluation on a widely-used relation extraction dataset (TACRED), our method generates rules that outperform considerably manually written patterns.Our code, demo, and documentation is available at https://clulab.github.io/odinsynth.}",

    abstract = "Natural language (as opposed to structured communication modes
        such as Morse code) is by far the most common mode of communication
        between humans, and can thus provide significant insight into both
        individual mental states and interpersonal dynamics. As part of
        DARPA{'}s Artificial Social Intelligence for Successful Teams (ASIST)
        program, we are developing an AI agent team member that constructs and
        maintains models of their human teammates and provides appropriate
        task-relevant advice to improve team processes and mission performance.
        One of the key components of this agent is a module that uses a
        rule-based approach to extract task-relevant events from natural
        language utterances in real time, and publish them for consumption by
        downstream components. In this case study, we evaluate the performance
        of our rule-based event extraction system on a recently conducted ASIST
        experiment consisting of a simulated urban search and rescue mission in
        Minecraft. We compare the performance of our approach with that of a
        zero-shot neural classifier, and find that our approach outperforms the
        classifier for all event types, even when the classifier is used in an
        oracle setting where it knows how many events should be extracted from
        each utterance.",

answering, but, in general, can only capitalize on direct evidence seen
during training. For example, monolingual alignment models acquire term
alignment probabilities from semi-structured data such as question-answer
pairs; neural network language models learn term embeddings from
unstructured text. All this knowledge is then used to estimate the semantic
similarity between question and answer candidates.  We introduce a
higher-order formalism that allows all these lexical semantic models to
chain direct evidence to construct indirect associations between question
and answer texts, by casting the task as the traversal of graphs that encode
direct term associations.  Using a corpus of 10,000 questions from Yahoo!
Answers, we experimentally demonstrate that higher-order methods are broadly
applicable to alignment and language models, across both word and syntactic
representations. We show that an important criterion for success is
controlling for the semantic drift that accumulates during graph traversal.
All in all, the proposed higher-order approach improves five out of the six
lexical semantic models investigated, with relative gains of up to +13\%
over their first-order variants. },

Our approach addresses this task as link prediction over a graph that contains over 2M influence statements such as ``CTCF activates FOXA1'', which were automatically extracted using open-domain machine reading. We model this prediction task using graph-based features extracted from the above influence graph, as well as from a citation graph that captures scientific communities. We evaluated the proposed approach through backtesting. Although the data is heavily unbalanced (50 times more negative examples than positives), our approach predicts which influence links will be discovered in the ``near future'' with a F1 score of 27 points, and a mean average precision of 68\%. },

    abstract = "The general goal of text simplification (TS) is to reduce text complexity for human consumption. In this paper, we investigate another potential use of neural TS: assisting machines performing natural language processing (NLP) tasks. We evaluate the use of neural TS in two ways: simplifying input texts at prediction time and augmenting data to provide machines with additional information during training. We demonstrate that the latter scenario provides positive effects on machine performance on two separate datasets. In particular, the latter use of TS improves the performances of LSTM (1.82{--}1.98{\%}) and SpanBERT (0.7{--}1.3{\%}) extractors on TACRED, a complex, large-scale, real-world relation extraction task. Further, the same setting yields improvements of up to 0.65{\%} matched and 0.62{\%} mismatched accuracies for a BERT text classifier on MNLI, a practical natural language inference dataset.",

Our approach uses a multi-task learning architecture, which jointly trains a classifier for relation extraction, and a sequence model that labels words in the context of the relation that explain the decisions of the relation classifier. We also convert the model outputs to rules to bring global explanations to this approach. This sequence model is trained using a hybrid strategy: supervised, when supervision from pre-existing patterns is available, and semi-supervised otherwise. In the latter situation, we treat the sequence model’s labels as latent variables, and learn the best assignment that maximizes the performance of the relation classifier. We evaluate the proposed approach on the two datasets and show that the sequence model provides labels that serve as accurate explanations for the relation classifier’s decisions, and, importantly, that the joint training generally improves the performance of the relation classifier. We also evaluate the performance of the generated rules and show that the new rules are great add-on to the manual rules and bring the rule-based system much closer to the neural models.}",

  abstract = {We propose an unsupervised method for the identification of bridge phrases in multi-hop question answering (QA). Our method
constructs a graph of noun phrases from the question and the available context, and applies the Steiner tree algorithm to identify
the minimal sub-graph that connects all question phrases. Nodes in the sub-graph that bridge loosely-connected or disjoint
subsets of question phrases due to low-strength semantic relations are extracted as bridge phrases. The identified bridge phrases
are then used to expand the query based on the initial question, helping in increasing the relevance of evidence that has little
lexical overlap or semantic relation with the question. Through an evaluation on HotpotQA(Yang et al., 2018), a popular dataset
for multi-hop QA, we show that our method yields: (a) improved evidence retrieval, (b) improved QA performance when using
the retrieved sentences; and (c) effective and faithful explanations when answers are provided.},
